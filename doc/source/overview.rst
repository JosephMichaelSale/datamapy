This library provides several tools for managing memory usage while accessing multiple large sets of data concurrently.

The implementation provided in this project uses the Python Imaging Library to read and store data in image files. However, the core memory management features of this project do not require the use of images.

The components included in this library were designed with expandability in mind and allow for easy expansion to accommodate other types of structured data.
